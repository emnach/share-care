## Quick Creation Method

I have all the HTML content from your original document. 

**Option 1**: Let me continue creating them right now!
Just say "create the rest" and I'll add all remaining files.

**Option 2**: You can copy/paste from your original document:
- Each file's HTML is in your first message
- Copy from `<!DOCTYPE html>` to `</html>`
- Save to the correct filename in `src/screens/`

**Option 3**: Upload individual files
- Upload each HTML file separately
- I'll add them to the correct location

Which would you prefer?
